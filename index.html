<ul>
<li>  Helping to elevate teams from 'Doing' Agile to 'Being' and 'Living' Agile.­</li>
<li>  Initiated and facilitated a "Pearson VUE Day of Code Retreat" to help developers learn new skills, focusing on practicing TDD, and pair programming.­</li>
<li>  Lead developer and Scrum Master on “Preview” project. Introduced several new development practices including TDD, Pair Programming, and CI enforced code coverage for all Java and JavaScript. Project released to production one month ahead of schedule.­ Included REST and SOAP API's.</li>
<li>  Introduced Pair Programming to Pearson VUE. My team was the first to use pair programming. Team members, while a bit reluctant at first, now enthusiastically pair daily and encourage other teams to use pairing also.</li>
<li>  Introduced NodeJS, Karma, Protractor, Bower, Istanbul, and Grunt to Pearson VUE. My team was the first to use NodeJS and other JavaScript tools to automate dependency resolution, testing and enforce code coverage minimums for JavaScript.</li>
<li>  Introduced story size constraints to Pearson VUE. My team was the first to require stories to be broken down (no larger than 2 days' work) before they can be included in a sprint. Now the team is clearer on what is needed, errors are constrained, and estimates are more accurate.</li>
<li>  Introduced AngularJS to Pearson VUE. My team was the first to use AngularJS and it has since been adopted in the reference architecture.</li>
<li>  Introduced the use of Puppet to the Pearson VUE development group. My team was the first to use Puppet to provision the development environment, cutting new developer on-boarding time by at least 8 hours.</li>
<li>  Introduced the use of Vagrant to the Pearson VUE development and QA groups. My team was the first to use Vagrant to do destructive testing of a production-like environment. Previous to the use of Vagrant, QA did not have the ability to test server failure related scenarios. Vagrant boxes were provisioned using Chef.</li>
<li>  Participated in the evaluation and selection of company-wide provisioning tools (Puppet vs Chef).</li>
<li>  Team member implementing Continuous­ Delivery pipeline using Puppet, Packer, and Vagrant­</li>
